				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In today&#8217;s world, most of us struggle to find a moment of quiet, let alone lasting <strong>inner peace</strong>. Much of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s activities were to show us how to create inner peace, for if we want peace in the world, we need to start by creating peace in ourselves. The following is reprinted from <strong><a title="The Wisdom of Sri Chimoy" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/philosophy/the-wisdom-of-sri-chinmoy/">The Wisdom of Sri Chinmoy</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>

<p><b>Question: </b>What steps can a person take to find inner peace?</p>
<p><strong>Sri Chinmoy: </strong>On a practical level, do not expect anything from others on the physical plane. Just give and give and give, like a mother who gives everything to her child thinking that the child is not in a position to give her anything in return.</p>
<p>Do not expect anything from the world; only love the world and offer your capacity, your inner wealth, your joy. Everything that you have, give to the world unconditionally. If you expect anything from the world, then you will feel miserable because the world does not understand you, the world does not care for you. If you can do anything unconditionally, then you will have peace of mind. This is one way.</p>
<p>The other way is to meditate on the heart, where there is constant joy, constant love. At that time you will not cry for appreciation from others. You will all the time depend on your inner Source, where there is infinite joy, infinite love, infinite peace. The best thing is to meditate on the heart. This second way is most effective.</p>
