				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In </em><a title="101 Meditation Techniques" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/meditation/101-meditation-techniques/">101 Meditation Techniques</a>,<em> Sri Chinmoy shares different techniques for entering the meditative state. The following is an easy technique for beginners to start with.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you breathe in, repeat once the name of God, the Christ or whomever you adore. Or, if your Master has given you a mantra, you can repeat that. This breath does not have to be long or deep. Then hold your breath and repeat the same name four times. And when you breathe out, repeat two times the name or mantra that you have chosen. You inhale for one count, hold your breath for four counts and exhale for two counts, inwardly repeating the sacred word. If you simply count the numbers—one-four-two—you do not get any vibration or inner feeling. But when you say the name of God, immediately God’s divine qualities enter into you. Then, when you hold your breath, these divine qualities rotate inside you, entering into all your impurities, obscurities, imperfections and limitations. And when you breathe out, these same divine qualities carry away all your undivine, unprogressive and destructive qualities.</p>
<p>In the beginning you can start with a one-four-two count. When you become experienced in this breathing exercise, you will be able to do it to a count of four-sixteen-eight: breathing in for four counts, holding the breath for sixteen, and breathing out for eight. But this has to be done very gradually. Some people do an eight-thirty-two-sixteen count, but this is for the experts.</p>
