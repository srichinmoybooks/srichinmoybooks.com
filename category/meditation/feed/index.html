				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In </em><a title="Beyond Within: A Philosophy for the Inner Life" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/philosophy/beyond-within-a-philosophy-for-the-inner-life/">Beyond Within</a><em>, Sri Chinmoy provides sound advice on how to integrate the highest spiritual aspirations into your daily life. In the following, he answers a seeker who asked whether a thought of love that came during meditation should be taken in or rejected.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>When we get a message in our mind during meditation, we have to know whether it is in the lower mind, the physical mind—the restless, aggressive, destructive and doubtful mind—or in the calm mind, the vacant mind, the silent mind. When we receive a message in the silent mind, we should accept it and feel that it is the foundation stone on which we can build the Palace of Truth, Love, Divinity and Reality. This message actually originates in the soul or in the heart, and then enters into the mind. When the mind is absolutely still, calm and peaceful, we can hear that message.</p>
<p>Suppose you are meditating and after a few minutes a thought or idea comes into your mind, let us say that it is about sacrifice, that you will sacrifice something for a friend or relative or someone you know. This is not just an idea at that time; it is an ideal. When you accept an idea as your own, the idea does not remain an idea but becomes an ideal.</p>
<p>Whenever a divine thought enters into your mind, try to expand it. When an undivine thought comes into your mind, either reject it, or if you have enough inner strength, transform it. It is like this. Somebody has knocked at your door. If you know that you have enough strength to compel him to behave properly once he enters, then you can open the door and allow him to come in. But if you do not have the power to compel him to behave, then it would be wise to keep your door closed. Let it remain closed for a day or a month or for a year. When you gain more strength, then accept the challenge and open the door. For if these wrong thoughts are not conquered, they will come back to bother you again and again. First you reject, then you accept and transform, then finally you totally transcend.</p>
<p>We have to be a divine potter with the dirty clay of our thoughts. If the potter is afraid to touch the clay, if he refuses to touch it, then the clay will remain clay and the potter will not be able to offer anything to the world. But the potter is not afraid. He touches the clay and shapes it in his own way into something beautiful and useful. It is our own bounden duty to transform undivine thoughts. But when? When we are in a position to do it safely. If I am not a potter, what can I do with a lump of clay? If I touch it, I will only make myself dirty.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, a beginner should not allow any thought to enter his mind. He would like to allow his friends to enter, but he does not know who his friends are. And even if he does know who is friends are, when he opens the door for them he may find that his enemies are standing right in front of them, and before his friends can cross the threshold, his enemies are deep inside the room. Once the enemies enter, it is very difficult to chase them out. For that we need the strength of solid spiritual discipline.</p>
<p>There will come a a time when you can build on your divine ideas. Build your life of love on this thought that came to you. Love is absolutely necessary in the spiritual life. This is the love which permits us to see that all human being as are God. If we truly love God, we love all mankind as well. We cannot separate divine Love from an and God. Man and God are like a tree. If you go to man, the foot of the tree, with your divine Love, from there it is very easy to go up to God, the top of the tree.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">§§§§§§§</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Keep your mind centered on God. Your futile thoughts will be transformed into fertile ideas, your fertile ideas into glowing ideals and your glowing ideals into the all-fulfilling Infinitude.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s books are filled with <strong>meditation tips and techniques</strong>. The main thing to aim for in meditation is to silence your mind so that you can expand your consciousness into the great Beyond. The following tip is from the book </em><a title="Meditation: Man-Perfection in God-Satisfaction" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/sample-page/meditation-man-perfection-in-god-satisfaction/">Meditation: Man-Perfection in God-Satisfaction</a>.</p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>

<h3>Quieting the Mind</h3>
<p>No matter which path you follow for meditation, the first and foremost task is to try to make the mind calm and quiet. If the mind is constantly roaming, if it is all the time a victim of merciless thoughts, then you will make no progress whatsoever. The mind has to be made calm and quiet so that when the light descends from above, you can be fully conscious of it. In your conscious observation and conscious acceptance of light, you will enter into a profound meditation and see the purification, transformation and illumination of your life.</p>
<p>How will you make the mind calm and quiet? The mind has its own power, and right now this power is stronger than your present eagerness and determination to meditate. But if you can get help from your heart, then gradually you will be able to control your mind. The heart, in turn, gets constant assistance from the soul, which is all light and all power.<span id="more-203"></span></p>
<h3>Emptying the Mind</h3>
<p>You must not think that when there is nothing in your mind, you will become a fool or act like an idiot. This is not true. If you can keep your mind calm and quiet for ten or fifteen minutes, a new world will dawn within you. This is the root of all spiritual progress. Right now you can make your mind calm and quiet for only a few seconds, or for a minute, but if you can maintain your calmness, poise and tranquillity for half an hour or even for fifteen minutes, I assure you that inside your tranquillity a new world with tremendous divine light and power will grow.</p>
<p>When you do not have any thought in your mind, please do not feel that you are totally lost. On the contrary, feel that something divine is being prepared in your pure and aspiring nature. You cannot expect immediate results. The farmer sows the seed and then he waits; he never expects the crop to spring forth all at once. It takes a few weeks or a few months to germinate. Your mind can be like a fertile field. If you plant the seed of silence and poise and cultivate it patiently, sooner or later you are bound to reap the bumper crop of illumination.</p>
<p>The mind is not necessary for meditation, because thinking and meditating are absolutely different things. When we meditate, we do not think at all. The aim of meditation is to free ourselves from all thought. Thought is like a dot on a blackboard. Whether it is good or bad, it is there. Only if there is no thought whatsoever can we grow into the highest reality. Even in profound meditation thoughts can come in, but not in the highest, deepest meditation. In the highest meditation, there will be only light.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">§§§§§§§</p>
<blockquote><p>Slowly and steadily if you can still your restless mind, immediately and cheerfully God will open His measureless Heart.</p></blockquote>
