				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s writings offer both a peek at divine realisation as well as tips for living each day to the fullest. In this selection from </em><a title="My Life’s Soul-Journey: Daily Meditations for Ever Increasing Spiritual Fulfilment" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/inspiration/my-lifes-soul-journey/">My Life&#8217;s Soul-Journey,</a><em> he explains how to avoid a guilty conscience by correcting your actions immediately.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By having a guilty conscience you do not get light or wisdom. If you have done something that is not right, then try to do the right thing, the divine thing. This second, this minute you have used. You could have used it either for a right purpose or a wrong purpose. If you have used it for a wrong purpose, then use the following minute for a divine purpose. If you use this moment for a divine purpose without thinking of the previous minute when you did something wrong, then what happens? Your positive strength the will-power you have used to do the right thing, will then have power in its entirety, in its fulness. But if you think of the past minute with a sense of guilt, that you have done something wrong, and then the following minute you are determined to do the right thing, half of your power is again lost in darkness and only half can be utilized for the right action. So, try to bring to the fore your full power in the following minute and nullify the previous mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The sunlit way to realize God<br />
Is to clearly forget<br />
And wisely forgive<br />
One’s past failures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is an excerpt from Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s book, </em><a title="God Is: Selected Writings of Sri Chinmoy" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/philosophy/god-is-selected-writings-of-sri-chinmoy/">God Is</a><em>, a collection of his writings about God.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compassion is God&#8217;s immense and intense Concern for mankind. When we show compassion to others at the time of their need, compassion is sweet. When we receive compassion from others while we are in dire need, compassion is sweeter. And we we come to realise that it is God&#8217;s Compassion that is enabling us to fulfil our promise both to Heaven and to earth, Compassion is sweetest. Our promise to Heaven is to reveal our divine qualities here in earth. Our promise to earth is to manifest all our divine capacities so that Mother-Earth can utilise them for her own purposes.</p>
<p>We feel that if we can receive God&#8217;s most illumining Compassion, then our spiritual journey will be expedited. But how are we going to receive this Compassion from Above? We can easily do it if we feel that we are a child, a little divine child. When a human child cries, no matter where the mother is, she comes to comfort him, for by pleasing the child she gets satisfaction. Similarly, when we soulfully cry for God&#8217;s Compassion, God immediately descends with His Compassion-Power.</p>
<p>A child cries helplessly because he feels that without his mother&#8217;s help and guidance he cannot do anything. But the spiritual child does not cry with a sense of helplessness. He feels that there is a Source, and that Source is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. When we become soulful in our cry, we establish a free access to the Source. So the seeker in us, the divine child in us, cries soulfully and not helplessly.</p>
<p>Compassion wants to operate in us at every moment, but quite often, because of our ignorance, we resist Compassion consciously or unconsciously, even after we have begun to cry for it. In the ordinary life, if somebody wants to give  us something out of his infinite kindness, and we do not take it, then the person immediately withdraws his gift, as if to say that we do not deserve it. But God never withdraws His Compassion from us. On the contrary, He tries to offer more of His divine, unconditional Compassion.</p>
<p>Compassion is a power, an illumining power. But when we are extremely stubborn and reject Compassion totally and mercilessly, God at times relies on His Patience-Power. He knows that Eternity is at His disposal and that one day in the process of evolution we shall be able to receive His Compassion. Today if we do not achieve and receive His Compassion devotedly or gratefully, He does not mind. Tomorrow He will give us another opportunity, and in either the near or the distant future, we are bound to accept His Compassion-Power, for this alone can transform our nature. So God does not withdraw; He only uses another type of power, which we call patience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sri Chinmoy was born in the village of Shakpura in Bangladesh, formerly, part of India, and was raised in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry. In the following excerpt from <strong><a title="Yoga and the Spiritual Life" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/philosophy/yoga-and-the-spiritual-life/">Yoga and the Spiritual Life</a></strong>, Sri Chinmoy answers this question from a seeker, &#8220;I would frankly like to know what India&#8217;s spirituality has ever done for her. How is it that in spite of her yogis and saints, she is still a poor and backward country?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we must understand what has brought this situation about. In ancient India, the material life was not renounced. People in those days aspired for a synthesis of Matter and Spirit, and to some extent they were successful in achieving it. But there is a great gulf between that hoary past and the present.</p>
<p>In the later periods of India&#8217;s history, the saints and seers came to feel that the material life and the spiritual life could never go together, that they had to renounce the outer life in order to attain to God. Hence, the external life was neglected. This led to foreign conquests and many other troubles. Even today, the attitude that material prosperity and beauty should be negated is very common in India. This accounts for much of her continued poverty.</p>
<p>But at present there are spiritual giants in India who feel that God should be realised in His totality, that Creator and creation are one and inseparable. They advocate the acceptance of life, the real need for both progress and perfection in all spheres of human existence. This new approach is widely accepted in modern India.</p>
<p>India may be poverty-stricken today, but she will progress quickly by virtue of her new awareness and her new aspiration. She has not only magnanimity of heart but also the power to bring her soul&#8217;s strength to the fore and use it to solve all her problems.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The book, </em><a title="The Wisdom of Sri Chinmoy" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/philosophy/the-wisdom-of-sri-chinmoy/">The Wisdom of Sri Chinmoy</a><em>, contains questions and answers on a variety of topics. The following excerpt is from the section on Grace.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>How important is God&#8217;s grace in our spiritual progress?</p>
<p><strong>Sri Chinmoy:</strong> Before realisation, we think that our personal effort, our aspiration alone is responsible for our spiritual progress. At that time there is no such thing as grace for us. But after realisation, we come to see that there is no such thing as aspiration. Our progress is all due to divine grace.<span id="more-512"></span></p>
<p>In the ordinary human life there is no end to our desire. Today we want one car, tomorrow two cars, the day after tomorrow three cars: our desire goes on and on. In the world of aspiration and realisation, there is no end.</p>
<p>From an iota of peace, Light, and bliss, we try to get a large quantity, then an abundant measure. But we have to know who has inspired us to leave the world of desire and enter into the world of aspiration.</p>
<p>Amng the members of my family, my friends and all the people in the whole world, why is it that only I am aspiring, Who inspired me? Who compelled me to aspire? It was the divine grace of the Supreme that inspired me. how is it that my brother is not praying and meditating but I am crying to realize God? It is because of the highest power, the divine grace is operating in and through me. I have aspiration because God gave it to me. It is all His grace.</p>
<p>The sun is shining. It is up to us to open all the windows and the doors in order to receive the Light. Naturally, if we open up the doors and windows, then the sun will come in. Similarly, the divine grace is constantly showering down from above. Let us try always to receive it with our heart&#8217;s door wide open.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sri Chinmoy often talked about the importance of self-transcendence or self-transformation, the process of continually striving to be a better person and to reach a higher level of spirituality. The following excerpt is from </em><a title="My Life’s Soul-Journey: Daily Meditations for Ever Increasing Spiritual Fulfilment" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/inspiration/my-lifes-soul-journey/">My Life&#8217;s Soul-Journey</a><em>, a wonderful book with an inspiring reading for each day.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>It is never too late to transform one&#8217;s nature completely.</strong></p>
<p>One way to transform human nature is to bring down the divine, all-illumining light of the Supreme, enlarging one&#8217;s receptivity-vessel. Before human nature is transformed, it is full of darkness. Darkness can be removed only by bringing in light and not by anything else. We have to bring down light from above consciously and constantly and then expand our receptivity. The more we expand our receptivity, the more we can hold light inside ourselves.</p>
<p>Another way to transform human nature is to see the divine light in each human being and nothing else. Just because we see something undivine in ourselves and in others, it has become impossible for us to transform either our own nature or human nature in general. No matter what they do, what they say or what they are, if we consciously and constantly see only the divine light in others—the light we are bringing down from above—then automatically human nature will be transformed. If we see light in each individual and in our own nature, then it is not only possible but also inevitable to transform human nature and earth&#8217;s nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Face your lower nature<br />
Bravely.<br />
Your higher nature<br />
Is about to reach you<br />
Happily<br />
Plus proudly.</p>
