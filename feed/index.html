				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s writings offer both a peek at divine realisation as well as tips for living each day to the fullest. In this selection from </em><a title="My Life’s Soul-Journey: Daily Meditations for Ever Increasing Spiritual Fulfilment" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/inspiration/my-lifes-soul-journey/">My Life&#8217;s Soul-Journey,</a><em> he explains how to avoid a guilty conscience by correcting your actions immediately.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By having a guilty conscience you do not get light or wisdom. If you have done something that is not right, then try to do the right thing, the divine thing. This second, this minute you have used. You could have used it either for a right purpose or a wrong purpose. If you have used it for a wrong purpose, then use the following minute for a divine purpose. If you use this moment for a divine purpose without thinking of the previous minute when you did something wrong, then what happens? Your positive strength the will-power you have used to do the right thing, will then have power in its entirety, in its fulness. But if you think of the past minute with a sense of guilt, that you have done something wrong, and then the following minute you are determined to do the right thing, half of your power is again lost in darkness and only half can be utilized for the right action. So, try to bring to the fore your full power in the following minute and nullify the previous mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The sunlit way to realize God<br />
Is to clearly forget<br />
And wisely forgive<br />
One’s past failures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In </em><a title="101 Meditation Techniques" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/meditation/101-meditation-techniques/">101 Meditation Techniques</a>,<em> Sri Chinmoy shares different techniques for entering the meditative state. The following is an easy technique for beginners to start with.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you breathe in, repeat once the name of God, the Christ or whomever you adore. Or, if your Master has given you a mantra, you can repeat that. This breath does not have to be long or deep. Then hold your breath and repeat the same name four times. And when you breathe out, repeat two times the name or mantra that you have chosen. You inhale for one count, hold your breath for four counts and exhale for two counts, inwardly repeating the sacred word. If you simply count the numbers—one-four-two—you do not get any vibration or inner feeling. But when you say the name of God, immediately God’s divine qualities enter into you. Then, when you hold your breath, these divine qualities rotate inside you, entering into all your impurities, obscurities, imperfections and limitations. And when you breathe out, these same divine qualities carry away all your undivine, unprogressive and destructive qualities.</p>
<p>In the beginning you can start with a one-four-two count. When you become experienced in this breathing exercise, you will be able to do it to a count of four-sixteen-eight: breathing in for four counts, holding the breath for sixteen, and breathing out for eight. But this has to be done very gradually. Some people do an eight-thirty-two-sixteen count, but this is for the experts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The following is an excerpt from Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s book, </em><a title="God Is: Selected Writings of Sri Chinmoy" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/philosophy/god-is-selected-writings-of-sri-chinmoy/">God Is</a><em>, a collection of his writings about God.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compassion is God&#8217;s immense and intense Concern for mankind. When we show compassion to others at the time of their need, compassion is sweet. When we receive compassion from others while we are in dire need, compassion is sweeter. And we we come to realise that it is God&#8217;s Compassion that is enabling us to fulfil our promise both to Heaven and to earth, Compassion is sweetest. Our promise to Heaven is to reveal our divine qualities here in earth. Our promise to earth is to manifest all our divine capacities so that Mother-Earth can utilise them for her own purposes.</p>
<p>We feel that if we can receive God&#8217;s most illumining Compassion, then our spiritual journey will be expedited. But how are we going to receive this Compassion from Above? We can easily do it if we feel that we are a child, a little divine child. When a human child cries, no matter where the mother is, she comes to comfort him, for by pleasing the child she gets satisfaction. Similarly, when we soulfully cry for God&#8217;s Compassion, God immediately descends with His Compassion-Power.</p>
<p>A child cries helplessly because he feels that without his mother&#8217;s help and guidance he cannot do anything. But the spiritual child does not cry with a sense of helplessness. He feels that there is a Source, and that Source is omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. When we become soulful in our cry, we establish a free access to the Source. So the seeker in us, the divine child in us, cries soulfully and not helplessly.</p>
<p>Compassion wants to operate in us at every moment, but quite often, because of our ignorance, we resist Compassion consciously or unconsciously, even after we have begun to cry for it. In the ordinary life, if somebody wants to give  us something out of his infinite kindness, and we do not take it, then the person immediately withdraws his gift, as if to say that we do not deserve it. But God never withdraws His Compassion from us. On the contrary, He tries to offer more of His divine, unconditional Compassion.</p>
<p>Compassion is a power, an illumining power. But when we are extremely stubborn and reject Compassion totally and mercilessly, God at times relies on His Patience-Power. He knows that Eternity is at His disposal and that one day in the process of evolution we shall be able to receive His Compassion. Today if we do not achieve and receive His Compassion devotedly or gratefully, He does not mind. Tomorrow He will give us another opportunity, and in either the near or the distant future, we are bound to accept His Compassion-Power, for this alone can transform our nature. So God does not withdraw; He only uses another type of power, which we call patience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sri Chinmoy was born in the village of Shakpura in Bangladesh, formerly, part of India, and was raised in the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry. In the following excerpt from <strong><a title="Yoga and the Spiritual Life" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/philosophy/yoga-and-the-spiritual-life/">Yoga and the Spiritual Life</a></strong>, Sri Chinmoy answers this question from a seeker, &#8220;I would frankly like to know what India&#8217;s spirituality has ever done for her. How is it that in spite of her yogis and saints, she is still a poor and backward country?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we must understand what has brought this situation about. In ancient India, the material life was not renounced. People in those days aspired for a synthesis of Matter and Spirit, and to some extent they were successful in achieving it. But there is a great gulf between that hoary past and the present.</p>
<p>In the later periods of India&#8217;s history, the saints and seers came to feel that the material life and the spiritual life could never go together, that they had to renounce the outer life in order to attain to God. Hence, the external life was neglected. This led to foreign conquests and many other troubles. Even today, the attitude that material prosperity and beauty should be negated is very common in India. This accounts for much of her continued poverty.</p>
<p>But at present there are spiritual giants in India who feel that God should be realised in His totality, that Creator and creation are one and inseparable. They advocate the acceptance of life, the real need for both progress and perfection in all spheres of human existence. This new approach is widely accepted in modern India.</p>
<p>India may be poverty-stricken today, but she will progress quickly by virtue of her new awareness and her new aspiration. She has not only magnanimity of heart but also the power to bring her soul&#8217;s strength to the fore and use it to solve all her problems.</p>

The following excerpt is from the section on Grace.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong>How important is God&#8217;s grace in our spiritual progress?</p>
<p><strong>Sri Chinmoy:</strong> Before realisation, we think that our personal effort, our aspiration alone is responsible for our spiritual progress. At that time there is no such thing as grace for us. But after realisation, we come to see that there is no such thing as aspiration. Our progress is all due to divine grace.<span id="more-512"></span></p>
<p>In the ordinary human life there is no end to our desire. Today we want one car, tomorrow two cars, the day after tomorrow three cars: our desire goes on and on. In the world of aspiration and realisation, there is no end.</p>
<p>From an iota of peace, Light, and bliss, we try to get a large quantity, then an abundant measure. But we have to know who has inspired us to leave the world of desire and enter into the world of aspiration.</p>
<p>Amng the members of my family, my friends and all the people in the whole world, why is it that only I am aspiring, Who inspired me? Who compelled me to aspire? It was the divine grace of the Supreme that inspired me. how is it that my brother is not praying and meditating but I am crying to realize God? It is because of the highest power, the divine grace is operating in and through me. I have aspiration because God gave it to me. It is all His grace.</p>
<p>The sun is shining. It is up to us to open all the windows and the doors in order to receive the Light. Naturally, if we open up the doors and windows, then the sun will come in. Similarly, the divine grace is constantly showering down from above. Let us try always to receive it with our heart&#8217;s door wide open.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sri Chinmoy often talked about the importance of self-transcendence or self-transformation, the process of continually striving to be a better person and to reach a higher level of spirituality. The following excerpt is from </em><a title="My Life’s Soul-Journey: Daily Meditations for Ever Increasing Spiritual Fulfilment" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/inspiration/my-lifes-soul-journey/">My Life&#8217;s Soul-Journey</a><em>, a wonderful book with an inspiring reading for each day.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>It is never too late to transform one&#8217;s nature completely.</strong></p>
<p>One way to transform human nature is to bring down the divine, all-illumining light of the Supreme, enlarging one&#8217;s receptivity-vessel. Before human nature is transformed, it is full of darkness. Darkness can be removed only by bringing in light and not by anything else. We have to bring down light from above consciously and constantly and then expand our receptivity. The more we expand our receptivity, the more we can hold light inside ourselves.</p>
<p>Another way to transform human nature is to see the divine light in each human being and nothing else. Just because we see something undivine in ourselves and in others, it has become impossible for us to transform either our own nature or human nature in general. No matter what they do, what they say or what they are, if we consciously and constantly see only the divine light in others—the light we are bringing down from above—then automatically human nature will be transformed. If we see light in each individual and in our own nature, then it is not only possible but also inevitable to transform human nature and earth&#8217;s nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Face your lower nature<br />
Bravely.<br />
Your higher nature<br />
Is about to reach you<br />
Happily<br />
Plus proudly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In </em><a title="Beyond Within: A Philosophy for the Inner Life" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/philosophy/beyond-within-a-philosophy-for-the-inner-life/">Beyond Within</a><em>, Sri Chinmoy provides sound advice on how to integrate the highest spiritual aspirations into your daily life. In the following, he answers a seeker who asked whether a thought of love that came during meditation should be taken in or rejected.</em></p>
<p><em>*Jharna-Kala Fountain-Art by Sri Chinmoy</em></p>
<hr />
<p>When we get a message in our mind during meditation, we have to know whether it is in the lower mind, the physical mind—the restless, aggressive, destructive and doubtful mind—or in the calm mind, the vacant mind, the silent mind. When we receive a message in the silent mind, we should accept it and feel that it is the foundation stone on which we can build the Palace of Truth, Love, Divinity and Reality. This message actually originates in the soul or in the heart, and then enters into the mind. When the mind is absolutely still, calm and peaceful, we can hear that message.</p>
<p>Suppose you are meditating and after a few minutes a thought or idea comes into your mind, let us say that it is about sacrifice, that you will sacrifice something for a friend or relative or someone you know. This is not just an idea at that time; it is an ideal. When you accept an idea as your own, the idea does not remain an idea but becomes an ideal.</p>
<p>Whenever a divine thought enters into your mind, try to expand it. When an undivine thought comes into your mind, either reject it, or if you have enough inner strength, transform it. It is like this. Somebody has knocked at your door. If you know that you have enough strength to compel him to behave properly once he enters, then you can open the door and allow him to come in. But if you do not have the power to compel him to behave, then it would be wise to keep your door closed. Let it remain closed for a day or a month or for a year. When you gain more strength, then accept the challenge and open the door. For if these wrong thoughts are not conquered, they will come back to bother you again and again. First you reject, then you accept and transform, then finally you totally transcend.</p>
<p>We have to be a divine potter with the dirty clay of our thoughts. If the potter is afraid to touch the clay, if he refuses to touch it, then the clay will remain clay and the potter will not be able to offer anything to the world. But the potter is not afraid. He touches the clay and shapes it in his own way into something beautiful and useful. It is our own bounden duty to transform undivine thoughts. But when? When we are in a position to do it safely. If I am not a potter, what can I do with a lump of clay? If I touch it, I will only make myself dirty.</p>
<p>In the spiritual life, a beginner should not allow any thought to enter his mind. He would like to allow his friends to enter, but he does not know who his friends are. And even if he does know who is friends are, when he opens the door for them he may find that his enemies are standing right in front of them, and before his friends can cross the threshold, his enemies are deep inside the room. Once the enemies enter, it is very difficult to chase them out. For that we need the strength of solid spiritual discipline.</p>
<p>There will come a a time when you can build on your divine ideas. Build your life of love on this thought that came to you. Love is absolutely necessary in the spiritual life. This is the love which permits us to see that all human being as are God. If we truly love God, we love all mankind as well. We cannot separate divine Love from an and God. Man and God are like a tree. If you go to man, the foot of the tree, with your divine Love, from there it is very easy to go up to God, the top of the tree.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">§§§§§§§</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Keep your mind centered on God. Your futile thoughts will be transformed into fertile ideas, your fertile ideas into glowing ideals and your glowing ideals into the all-fulfilling Infinitude.</p>

Much of Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s activities were to show us how to create inner peace, for if we want peace in the world, we need to start by creating peace in ourselves. The following is reprinted from <strong><a title="The Wisdom of Sri Chimoy" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/philosophy/the-wisdom-of-sri-chinmoy/">The Wisdom of Sri Chinmoy</a>.</strong></em></p>

<p><b>Question: </b>What steps can a person take to find inner peace?</p>
<p><strong>Sri Chinmoy: </strong>On a practical level, do not expect anything from others on the physical plane. Just give and give and give, like a mother who gives everything to her child thinking that the child is not in a position to give her anything in return.</p>
<p>Do not expect anything from the world; only love the world and offer your capacity, your inner wealth, your joy. Everything that you have, give to the world unconditionally. If you expect anything from the world, then you will feel miserable because the world does not understand you, the world does not care for you. If you can do anything unconditionally, then you will have peace of mind. This is one way.</p>
<p>The other way is to meditate on the heart, where there is constant joy, constant love. At that time you will not cry for appreciation from others. You will all the time depend on your inner Source, where there is infinite joy, infinite love, infinite peace. The best thing is to meditate on the heart. This second way is most effective.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Sri Chinmoy&#8217;s books are filled with <strong>meditation tips and techniques</strong>. The main thing to aim for in meditation is to silence your mind so that you can expand your consciousness into the great Beyond. The following tip is from the book </em><a title="Meditation: Man-Perfection in God-Satisfaction" href="http://www.srichinmoybooks.com/books/sample-page/meditation-man-perfection-in-god-satisfaction/">Meditation: Man-Perfection in God-Satisfaction</a>.</p>

<h3>Quieting the Mind</h3>
<p>No matter which path you follow for meditation, the first and foremost task is to try to make the mind calm and quiet. If the mind is constantly roaming, if it is all the time a victim of merciless thoughts, then you will make no progress whatsoever. The mind has to be made calm and quiet so that when the light descends from above, you can be fully conscious of it. In your conscious observation and conscious acceptance of light, you will enter into a profound meditation and see the purification, transformation and illumination of your life.</p>
<p>How will you make the mind calm and quiet? The mind has its own power, and right now this power is stronger than your present eagerness and determination to meditate. But if you can get help from your heart, then gradually you will be able to control your mind. The heart, in turn, gets constant assistance from the soul, which is all light and all power.<span id="more-203"></span></p>
<h3>Emptying the Mind</h3>
<p>You must not think that when there is nothing in your mind, you will become a fool or act like an idiot. This is not true. If you can keep your mind calm and quiet for ten or fifteen minutes, a new world will dawn within you. This is the root of all spiritual progress. Right now you can make your mind calm and quiet for only a few seconds, or for a minute, but if you can maintain your calmness, poise and tranquillity for half an hour or even for fifteen minutes, I assure you that inside your tranquillity a new world with tremendous divine light and power will grow.</p>
<p>When you do not have any thought in your mind, please do not feel that you are totally lost. On the contrary, feel that something divine is being prepared in your pure and aspiring nature. You cannot expect immediate results. The farmer sows the seed and then he waits; he never expects the crop to spring forth all at once. It takes a few weeks or a few months to germinate. Your mind can be like a fertile field. If you plant the seed of silence and poise and cultivate it patiently, sooner or later you are bound to reap the bumper crop of illumination.</p>
<p>The mind is not necessary for meditation, because thinking and meditating are absolutely different things. When we meditate, we do not think at all. The aim of meditation is to free ourselves from all thought. Thought is like a dot on a blackboard. Whether it is good or bad, it is there. Only if there is no thought whatsoever can we grow into the highest reality. Even in profound meditation thoughts can come in, but not in the highest, deepest meditation. In the highest meditation, there will be only light.</p>
